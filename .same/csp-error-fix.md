# CSP Console Errors Fix

## Problem Identified
After deployment, console showed CSP violations:

```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
Refused to execute inline script because it violates CSP directive: "script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'"
```

## Root Cause
- Next.js generates inline scripts with specific hashes
- Our CSP policy was blocking these auto-generated scripts
- Next.js requires specific CSP configuration or no CSP at all
- Inline script execution is essential for Next.js hydration

## Solution Applied
1. **Temporarily disabled CSP** in netlify.toml
2. **Kept other security headers** (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
3. **Documented the issue** for future reference

## Alternative Solutions for Future
1. **Use Next.js CSP configuration** in next.config.js instead of netlify.toml
2. **Generate nonce-based CSP** that works with Next.js
3. **Use meta tags for CSP** instead of HTTP headers
4. **Configure CSP to allow specific hashes** generated by Next.js

## Current Status
- âœ… CSP disabled in netlify.toml
- âœ… Console errors should be resolved after deployment
- âœ… Other security headers remain active
- ðŸ”„ Monitor console after next deployment

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Test that console errors are gone after deployment
2. Consider implementing Next.js-compatible CSP solution
3. Monitor for any other security-related issues
